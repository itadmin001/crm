# commentary from Matthew:
We decided that instead of making the sign-up and sign-in their own pages, to turn them into modals to pop up when their respective buttons are pressed
I volunteered to work on the sign-up and sign-in modal:s: I took a modular approach to design each one by themselves in modal_test.html, and Jeremy made it easy to work on them
by using JavaScript to configure the modal open automatically whenever the page was loaded, so that I wouldn't have to click the button to open it everytime a change was made.
I had the initial designs done by night time on Friday so that Jeremy could put them into the landing and how it works pages

Saturday, I decided to work on the "How It Works" sections on the how_it_works.html page, by modifying code that was already created by Jeremy earlier on the landing page.  
After I had finished we found out that the modals somehow broke from moving them into their respective pages and Jeremy and I had to scramble to figure out why it was breaking;
when one of us fixed something, it seemed to break something for the other person.  That was hectic but we ended up leaving fixing the modals to me instead of us trying to solve it 
independently and now everything works as it should.  Please clap!
